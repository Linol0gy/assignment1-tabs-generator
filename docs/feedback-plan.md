## Feedback Collection Plan

The assignment requires feedback from **two family members**, **two friends**, and **two industry contacts**, plus confirmation that they completed the ethics survey. Use the checklist below to stay organised.

### 1. Preparation

- [ ] Spin up the application locally or on your cloud deployment.
- [ ] Prepare three short guided walkthroughs (Tabs Generator, Court Room scenario, API/Lambda preview).
- [ ] Print or share the survey link: <https://redcap.latrobe.edu.au/redcap/surveys/?s=PPEKFTMPXF4KKEFY>.

### 2. Interview Script

1. Record the participantâ€™s name, role (family/friend/industry), and contact date.
2. Demo the feature briefly, then ask:
   - What worked well?
   - What confused you or needs refinement?
   - Would this workflow suit your daily tasks?
3. Capture verbatim quotes where possible.
4. Confirm they completed the ethics survey and note the submission time.

### 3. Evidence to Retain

- Screenshots of the running app during the session.
- A short written summary per participant (store in `docs/feedback-notes/` or your preferred folder).
- Survey completion confirmation (verbal acknowledgement is acceptable; note the time).

### 4. Reporting Back

Add a summary of key findings to your final handover:

| Cohort   | Positive themes                         | Improvement areas                         |
|----------|-----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Family   |                                         |                                           |
| Friends  |                                         |                                           |
| Industry |                                         |                                           |

Keep the raw notes in case the assessor requests them. The table above can be copied into your final report or presentation slide deck.
